## Disclaimer

I'm not playing Minecraft anymore, so my will to do mods on this game is very low.

## When does version X gets published?

If I have the time and some motivation, I will update the mod to the latest version, but this is purely random (look at this [mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gm3-teleporter/files) for example) so I can't answer this question.

## The mod can work by simply updating the Minecraft version

If this is true, you can fork the repository of a mod, update the fabric.mod.json (**Fabric**) or the mods.toml (**Forge**) and then create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with the update, I check if I can launch it and publish the result on CurseForge/Modrinth.

## How does the version system works?

(I don't have the link to the page explaining it, but if I find it, I will add it here)

versions are named like that: X.Y.ZW

- With invisible small changes in the code itself or fixes: Z++
- Visible changes, new functions or deprecated functions: Y++
- Huge changes, rebase of the code: X++
- ``W`` can be omitted, it describe an alpha state ``a`` or a beta state ``b``, release is omitted
